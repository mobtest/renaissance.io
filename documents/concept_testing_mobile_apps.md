# Concept testing mobile apps

#Introduction
The goal of a concept test is to verify that there is a certain target market with a demand for your product. It is important to know who your target audience is, what problem you are solving for them or what need you are fullfilling.

##Setup
1. Get 50-100 respondents that fit the description of your target market
2. Prepare an interview with factual questions for them about their current modus operandi that you are about to change
3. Prepare materials that indicate or explain the working of your new app. Prototypes work great for this.
4. Decide whether you want to do the test remotely or in person. In person will give better results but is obviously more expensive.

##Define your target market
For concept testing it is important to know your potential customers.
Important traits to look at:

- country/continent
- male/female
- age
- income
- iOS or Android user (iOS users are much more early adopters and spend more money on apps)
- education

## Getting respondents
You can recruit respondents in multiple ways:

1. [Ask your target market](http://aytm.com/). Specialises in concept testing
2. [Surveymonkey Audience](http://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/audience/)
3. [Enroll by ZURB](http://www.enrollapp.com/)
4. Existing users of your other products
5. Followers on Facebook or Twitter

## The interview
Being rewarded for participating in your test makes it very likely that respondents want to please you.
So ask questions about facts that are pretty recent, for example:

1. How often did you do this last week?
2. How much time do you spend on average doing this?

Questions about how your idea would affect their live:

1. What is the goal of the prototype app?
2. What kind of functions does the app have?
3. How do you do this currently without this app?
4. How much less or more time would you spend doing your activity with this new app?
5. How often would you use it?
6. Where would you use it?


## Materials to outline your idea
You can have a story that you tell about your idea. Better is to have mockups or a prototype that indicates what the app will look like.

Tools to create a mockup or prototype:

1. Paper and pen
2. Keynote
3. Appgyver's Prototyper
4. HTML app
