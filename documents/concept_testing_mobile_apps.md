# Concept testing mobile apps

The goal of a concept test is to verify that there is a certain target market with a demand for your product. You are solving a problem for them, or fullfilling a need

##Setup
1. Get 10-50 respondents that fit in your target group
2. Prepare materials that indicate or explain the working of your new app
3. Decide whether you want to do the test remotely or in person. In person will give better results but is obviously more expensive

## Points of attention

### Get the right respondents
Think about who your target market is, and get respondents that represent that market.

### Avoid social desirable questions and subsequent answers
Being rewarded for participating in your test makes it very likely that respondents want to please 

## Questions to ask
1. What is the goal of the prototype app?
2. What kind of functions does the app have?
3. How do you do this currently without this app?
4. How much time do you spend on average doing this?
5. How do you feel about the current way you do this?
